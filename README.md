## 📦 llm-quick-access

**llm-quick-access** is an Electron application built with React and TypeScript. It provides a floating, always-available interface to interact with local LLMs via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Designed to boost productivity, it allows you to perform common AI-powered tasks—like proofreading, writing emails, or generating content—via configurable actions and keyboard shortcuts.

You can:

- ⚡ **Open a floating AI window anytime, anywhere**
  Just hit a keyboard shortcut (like `Alt + Space`) and a clean, draggable window pops up—right over whatever you’re doing. It’s like having your own personal assistant, always ready to help without interrupting your flow.

- 🧠 **Get help with everyday writing tasks—fast**
  Need to polish a message, write a quick email, or draft something for LinkedIn? Set up actions once, and trigger them whenever you need. No copy-pasting between apps, no friction.

- 🤖 **Let the app handle all the model setup for you**
  You don’t have to worry about downloading or managing LLMs. Behind the scenes, the app talks to Ollama, runs the right commands, and makes sure everything’s ready to go—automatically.

- ✍️ **Customize how actions behave and respond**
  You decide how each action works: set an initial prompt, choose the model, format the response, and control what goes in and out. It’s flexible, so it fits the way _you_ work.

- 🎹 **Use global shortcuts to trigger specific actions**
  Want to launch a proofreader or email writer with a single key combo? You can assign shortcuts to any action you create and use them from anywhere on your desktop.

- 📁 **Organize everything in a handy sidebar**
  All your custom actions live in a simple side panel—easy to browse, update, or launch on the fly.
